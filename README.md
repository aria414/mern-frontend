# MERN Lab

Get ready to build a MERN app with your team! For this lab, your goal is to build a
simple MERN app with Express on the back-end and React on the front-end.

## Prerequisites

- Mongo, Mongoose, Express and Node
- React, Components, State and Props
- React Component Lifecycle Methods (useEffect)

## Instructions

1.  Fork and Clone this repo
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.
1.  Create a Pull request on this repository with links to your repo(s).

Unlike most labs, for this one you will submit your work by **making a pull request**. If a pull request has not been performed up until now then the instructor will walk the class through performing one at the completion of this readme.

Use this repo to include both the frontend and backend servers. 

The frontend and the backend should be in two separate folders. They will each need to be a github repository.

## Requirements

Build a simple MERN app! Keep it very simple: **only** 1 model with full CRUD.

Your app will need to replicate the functionality and style of the Tunr image above. The app should:

- Only have one page, the homepage.
- Display a playlist and a favorite song list on the homepage
- Allow user to add a new song that has a title, artist and time (length of playtime) to a playlist 
- Allow user to favorite a song. When they favorite a song, a heart should appear next to the song in the playlist and the song should appear underneath the Favorite Songs List.
- Allow user to remove the song from the playlist
- Both servers must be deployed

## Presentations

Now it's your turn to present to the class.  Each group will be provided no more than 10min to present and each member must speak to something about the project.  

We ask that you present as follows and each person can take lead on one of those questions.

- Demo the full functionality of the app
- Discuss your workflow
- What was the most difficult part?
- What did you learn that you can leverage in the P3 project?
